# spotify_eda

In this project, I will visualize data of spotify soundtracks, conduct tasks such as which song is popular and play with some charts such as radar charts that were not used very often. 

The raw data can be found [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks)
